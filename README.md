# Nvidia-NIM_Model (Launched on Aug-27-2024)
This project demonstrates a powerful, real-time Q&A system using Nvidia's NIM model and LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) within a Streamlit application. This setup allows users to ask questions about documents, leveraging Nvidia's NIM language model and LangChain to retrieve relevant answers from a knowledge base effectively.

The workflow involves:

Data Ingestion: Upload documents for processing and indexing.

RAG Architecture: Combine retrieval and generation, where relevant document passages are fetched, and responses are dynamically generated.

Interactive Q&A Interface: Built with Streamlit to provide a user-friendly experience, making document querying intuitive and responsive.

This deployment offers an efficient way to implement document-based Q&A in any domain, suitable for applications in customer support, educational platforms, and enterprise knowledge management.
